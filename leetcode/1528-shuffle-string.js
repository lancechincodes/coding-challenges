/*
R: 
Input - string s and int arr indices of same length
Output - shuffled string in which character at the ith pos in s moves to indices[i] in the shuffled string

E:
Input: s = "codeleet", indices = [4,5,6,7,0,2,1,3]
Output: "leetcode"
Explanation: As shown, "codeleet" becomes "leetcode" after shuffling.

Input: s = "abc", indices = [0,1,2]
Output: "abc"
Explanation: After shuffling, each character remains in its position.
